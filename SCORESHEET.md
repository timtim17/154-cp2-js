**Overall Comments:**
WOW! This page is amazing! It looks great, has nice animations, is very feature rich, and is very responsive. It makes me wonder if perhaps you have been working on this project prior to this class, haha. Your code is also very clean from a code quality perspective, which is impressive given how much you wrote.

I've left some feedback that should be useful for HW2 and beyond, so be sure to give it a look.
